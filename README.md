**`Software Enginer (Developer/Creator/Gamer)`**

I am a junior Full-Stack developer who is rapidly pursuing excellence. Every project I create is either to develop my skills or out of personal interest. Here I will solve problems related to IT, from writing firmware for dummies to developing applications that support everyday life. I plan to describe each project in detail, analyzing the solution to problems step by step.

P.S. My goal is to work at Google. If you're reading this, Google, get me on your team!
